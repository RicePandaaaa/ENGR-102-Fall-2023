    "Up until now, input has been provided for you to hard-code into your program or it showed up in the form of user input (with `input()`). Now a new form of input (and output) is introduced: files! The most basic file type that you probably end up using will be a text file. It just stores text. These files have the `.txt` extension. An example is the \"example.txt\" file in the same folder as these notes. You can theoretically access and use any file type: you just need to ensure that your code has the correct support for the file extension you want to use.\n",

For example, `csv` files can be read normally with basic Python, but it is more ideal to open `csv` files with the creatively-named `csv` module. The `csv` module will not be tested: I only reference it for your information. If you wish to try it out, do so as you like but do not do so expecting to be tested on it. In fact, it may be *banned* from usage as it overly simplifies certain types of problems."

In simple terms, Python has its own data type for files, and you can store a file as something we call a file object. This special object is something you can interact with to tell Python to do stuff with your file data. The actual specifics of what a file object, or any object, really is are not necessary to know. You'll run into objects a lot more once you get into what we call \"classes\" and eventually what is called \"object-orientated programming\" (OOP).

    "So this covers the first three bullet points (making the book, storing the book, and opening the book). First, let's talk about `open()`. `open()` is a built-in function that lets you create a file object given a file directory and the access mode. By default, Python will look for files in the same folder as your code. You may notice that this notebook is in the same folder (\"Module 11 - Files\") as the text file (\"example.txt\"). This means that I can just tell Python to directly look for the file. Suppose the file directory looked like this though:\n",

    "```css\n",
    "> Module 11 - Files\n",
    "  > Files\n",
    "    - example.txt\n",
    "  - module_eleven_notes.ipynb\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The text file is no longer in the same folder. My directory must tell Python where to navigate *starting* in the folder the file I am running is currently in. So, I am in \"Module 11 - Files\" and thus, I'll navigate from there. I need to first access the \"Files\" folder and then I get to \"examples.txt\", so my directory becomes `\"Files/examples.txt\"`. When in doubt, just place your file in the same folder as your code or use absolute path (tells Python where to go starting at the very root of your file directory, so it doesn't matter where your code is).\n",
    "\n",
    "<h5 style=\"color: orange;\"> Access Modes </h5>\n",
    "Access modes tell Python how exactly you want to access the file. There are several options, with the important ones being:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `r`: read-only mode\n",
    "- `a`: append-only mode\n",
    "- `w`: write-only mode\n",

    "- `r+`: read + write mode\n",
    "- `a+`: append + read mode\n",
    "- `w+`: write + read mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Read only mode means that you can only read the file. You can access the contents, but you cannot overwrite, remove, or add any data. Append only mode means that you just want to add data to the end of the file. Write only mode means that the entire file is cleared and you can add to the file just like append. A second thing that write only mode does is that it will also create the file if it does not exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Append + read mode is neat where you can read the file *and* add data to the end. However, `r+` and `w+` can be a bit confusing since they both allow for reading and writing. Note that `r+` has `r` in its name, which means read mode is its priority. The file will not be wiped (which write mode usually does), but in this case, you start writing data from the top of the file, overwriting any lines you write to. `w+` will clear the file first and allow you to write to the file, but you can still read the file contents. The `+` modes are rarely used, but I mention them for the sake of completion. I recommend you look up examples and play around with the modes by yourself to fully understand the modes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now specifically for the code from Example 1, the file is opened in read only mode due to the `\"r\"` passed into `open()`. `open()` itself is the act of opening the book."
