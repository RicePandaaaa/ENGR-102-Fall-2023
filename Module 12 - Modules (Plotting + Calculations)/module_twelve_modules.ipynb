    "Modules, or libraries, are files containing Python code that can be executed by other programs when imported. In fact, you've used modules already, such as `math`. Once you import a module, you gain access to all public code, including functions that can help you do something that would be incredibly difficult to do manually. In fact, technically any Python file you have made so far can be a module, though whether they'd be useful or helpful is a whole another story.\n",

This is a problem when you have a lot of modules being imported as it is harder to specify a function's usage (`log()` is a lot more vague than `math.log()`) and when modules have functions that share the same name (such as the two modules I have above). Let's go ahead and try importing the two modules first.\n"

    "When Python imports a module, it *must* execute the file. This is how Python works. There's no way around it. So when I imported the two modules in Example 12-1, Python actually ran both files. It makes sense that when Python runs `oyoy.py` that it would output \"OY OY\" due to the `print()` statement. So why is there no output from `yoyo.py` although it too has a `print()` statement? What exactly does that `if` statement do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement basically says, if the file I am *directly* running is indeed the same one Python is in, then Python will execute the code in the `if` statement. Now, if Python is in the file, but the original file being run is different, then the code in the `if` statement should be skipped. In my example above, the original code being run is the code block that contains Example 12-1, *not* `yoyo.py`. So when Python goes into `yoyo.py` to run it (because `yoyo` is being imported), Python notes that `yoyo.py` is not the original file that Python is running and skips the `if` statement and thus skips the `print` statement too.\n",
