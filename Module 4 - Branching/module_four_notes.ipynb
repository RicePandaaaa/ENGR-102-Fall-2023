    "\n",
    "These are any expressions that evaluate to `True` or `False`, hence the name, \"boolean\" expressions. With math, you can perform basic mathematical operations to get numeric outputs (rarely strings). With booleans, they have their own set of operations you can use to create boolean expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before I dive into these operations (and their associated operators), I want to do a quick English example. Let's say I went shopping and I only want to buy a sandwich if it meets these conditions:\n",
    "- Less than 5 USD in cost\n",
    "- Hasn't expired yet\n",
    "- Is actually a sandwich or at least has bread as a major component\n",
    "\n",
    "As one sentence, I would say that I only get a sandwich if and only if it is less than 5 USD in cost, and it hasn't expired yet, and either it is a sandwich or has bread as a major component. As psuedocode, this would be:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if (cost less than 5 USD) and (has not expired) and (is sandwich or has bread)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that however I write this, there are only two possibilities, either the entire condition is `True` or the entire condition is `False`. In English, it is pretty obvious how I can calculate the final result of the above expression: just substitute in `True` or `False` for the conditions and simplify. For example, if I bought a 3 USD bread soup that hasn't expired, I would get:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if True and True and (False or True)\n",
    "if (True and True) and (False or True)\n",
    "if (True) and (True) => True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can determine for yourself given the information that I would indeed buy the bread soup since it fits all my criteria. Now, this is a very basic example: you can create (and later simplify) complex expressions. These expressions may not be necessarily complex in terms of difficulty but rather in length. \n",

    "You have two types of operators: relational and boolean. Despite their different names, they both are used to form conditionals and boolean expressions. In other words, they will output a boolean after evaluation. These operators are as follows:\n",

    "- `and`\n",
    "- `or`\n",
    "\n",
    "All these operators are more or less self-explanatory. For the relational operators, if the expression is true, then `True` is the result, otherwise, the result is `False`. For the boolean operators:\n",
    "- `not` is attached to the start of an expression and reverses the output\n",
    "- `and` returns `True` if and only if both values to the left and right of it evaluate to `True`, else it returns `False`\n",
    "- `or` returns `True` if and only if at least one value out of the two (the one to its left and the one to its right) is `True`\n",
    "\n",
    "The truth tables are shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "| a | b | not a | a or b | a and b |\n",
    "+---+---+-------+--------+---------+\n",
    "| T | T |   F   |   T    |    T    |\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The tricky thing with the relational operators is that different types have different behaviors. Comparing two numbers works exactly the same as real life (for example, `9 < 10` is `True`). However, what happens if we compare two strings using a relational operator?"
