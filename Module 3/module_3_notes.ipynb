    "In real life, we classify values as certain types and depending on the type of value, we can do different things to them. The same is done in Python: Python has types of data (some basic, some more complex) and depending on which type of data something is, you can perform certain things to them. Generally, you will be dealing with the four basic data types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `str`: read as \"string\", this data type represents any sort of text enclosed by a pair (or three pairs) of double or single quotes\n",
    "- `int`: read as int or integer, this data type represents any mathematical integer\n",
    "- `float`: read as float, this data type represents any number that has a decimal point\n",
    "- `bool`: read as bool or more formally known as boolean, this data type represents either `True`, `False`, or any value that is equivalent to those two values\n",
    "\n",
    "I'll refer to these types as strings, integers, floats, and booleans, but I may interchange them with `str`, `int`, `float`, and `bool`. You've used these before (except for `bool`). In Module 1, we used `print` to output strings and in Modules 1 and 2, we used integers to do some basic math. The outputs of some code in Module 3 had numbers that ended with \".0\", which means that they are floats."

As said before, if the number has more digits than `x`, then the number will take up just as much space as possible without taking extra space. `y` is how many decimal points to round to (this is proper rounding so will round down if < 0.5, round up otherwise). `f` is not actually a value but rather the letter: this signifies that this is float formatting, so it will output the decimal points."
