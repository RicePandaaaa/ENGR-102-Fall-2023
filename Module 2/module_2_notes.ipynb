If you wanted to re-use a value or just in general, have Python remember something, we use something called variables. You can refer to a variable as a box of memory: it has a name so Python knows which variable is which, and it stores some value inside of it."

    "- Variables can start only with a letter or an underscore\n",

    "- Variables cannot be the same as a reserved keyword (these are words with special meanings built into Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "Every seasoned programmer will also tell you to name your variables appropriately such that the name of the variable immediately tells people (not just yourself) what the variable is used for. This prevents confusion if you ever look back at your code someday and saves others time trying to decipher your code. In other words, if someone random can't make a somewhat accurate guess of what value your variable should hold by just looking at the name, you need a better name. Obviously context does matter: if you're doing a math equation then `x` can be valid, but naming three numbers `a`, `aa`, and `aaa` generally is a very bad idea."

    "<h2> Math Assignment Operators </h2>\n",

    "- Addition (`+=`)\n",
    "- Subtraction (`-=`)\n",
    "- Multiplication (`*=`)\n",
    "- Division (`/=`)\n",
    "- Power (`**=`)\n",
    "- Floor Division (`//=`)\n",
    "- Modulus (`%=`)\n",
    "\n",
    "All we did was add the operator to the front of the assignment operator! Now the variable will have the operation applied to it using the right-hand value to compute. For example, assuming we have `x = 2`, then `x += 3` is the same as `x = x + 3` or `x **= 3` is the same as `x **= 3`. You can visually see that the right hand value is used as the second number (or in other words, always on the right side of the operator) and the variable itself is always the left hand value (or on the left of the operator). This shorthand is very neat especially for longer calculations.\n",
