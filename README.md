# Fall 2023 - ENGR 102 Supplemental Resources

Howdy! My name is Anthony Pham, and at the time of creating this repository, I am a senior MXET (Mechatronics track) major, class of 2025, and I am also a peer teacher for ENGR 102! These supplemental resources will contain:
<ul>
  <li>A .ipynb file with reviews note I made about each module</li>
  <li>Some practice problems and their solutions (if applicable)</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/RicePandaaaa/ENGR-102-Fall-2023/blob/main/README.md#videos">Topic review videos made by me</a></li>
</ul>

These resources are sorted by modules (one module per week essentially), so if you're looking for Module 3 or Week 3 content, check the Module 3 folder! This repository updates slowly over time, and thus can be incomplete. All code, notes, and videos posted here are my own, but they are made with lecture notes in mind (as these are supplementary, not a replacement of classroom resources). Also any sort of practice problems used are of my own unless otherwise stated (sometimes I'll use previous exam questions with professor approval).

## Using the Resources
The videos and practice problems should be easy enough to use. The code you can download and put into an IDE to view, and the videos are uploaded as YouTube links you can copy-paste into your browser to view. However, the .ipynb files may be awkward to use. You can download them and upload to Google Colab, or open any IDE that supports these ipython notebooks (such as Visual Studio) and open them there. For Visual Studio, ensure you have the following extensions downloaded:
<ul>
  <li>Jupyter</li>
  <li>Jupyter Slide Show</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook Renderers</li>
  <li>Jupyter Keymap</li>
  <li>Jupyter Cell Tags</li>
</ul>

If you just want to read over the notes (in the ipynb files), you can just click on the file in Github to view it, and all the notes, code, and code ouputs should be visible! You only need to upload and run on your machine if you wish to make any edits to the code to try stuff out yourself.
