Your nest could be three-deep (as in a loop in a loop in a loop), four-deep, etc. You might also hear these sort of loops be defined by how many \"dimensions\" (loops) they have. The nested loop from Example 16 has two loops so it would be considered 2D. A three-deep loop would be called 3D, a four-deep loop would be called 4D, etc. I'm not entirely sure if there's an actual term for how deeply nested a loop is, but people should understand you regardless."
